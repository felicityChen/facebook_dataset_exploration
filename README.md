# facebook_dataset_exploration
Learning objectives: 
1) Learn and practice Python's data cleaning and visualization libraries
2) Practice designing and analyzing A/B tests (i.e. implement statistical significance concepts)
3) Gain familiarity with Facebook's dataset

Bonus: visualize and analyze social networks in Python (not able to do in this dataset, since we don't have data on which users d

Data cleaning and visualization
1) What are the high level demographics of Facebook users?
2) What are the most important user metrics to focus on? 
3) Which user characteristics correlate with more favourable business metrics? 

Designing pseudo-A/B tests
1) How many users do we need in the experiment to achieve a desired statistical significance and power?

Analyzing pseudo-A/B test
1) What's the difference in the key metric values (include statistical significance + confidence interval)?
